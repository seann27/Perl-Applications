This application performs two BLAST searches depending on accession numbers returned as top hits. In order to parse BLAST results for the top hits, BLAST output files are generated with each BLAST and denoted by their status (PRIMARY, SECONDARY, etc...). The accession number which was entered for the supplemented files was AAL01119. The database used for this assignment was the GenPept database from NCBI.
